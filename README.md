# homeboy-rigs

Personal `homeboy rig`, `homeboy stack`, and portable bench assets. The repo is organized by the fully qualified GitHub repo or site/workspace that owns the workflow.

A **rig** is a declarative spec for a reproducible local dev environment: components, services, symlinks, patches, and pipelines for `up` / `check` / `down`. See: [homeboy rig docs](https://github.com/Extra-Chill/homeboy/tree/main/docs).

## Layout

```text
<owner>/<repo-or-site>/
  rigs/<id>/rig.json
  stacks/    # homeboy stack specs
  bench/     # portable bench workloads used by those rigs
```

Examples:

```text
Automattic/studio/rigs/studio/rig.json
Automattic/studio/stacks/studio-combined.json
Automattic/studio/bench/studio-agent-runtime.bench.mjs
WordPress/wordpress-playground/stacks/playground-combined.json
chubes4/intelligence-chubes4/rigs/intelligence-chubes4/rig.json
```

This keeps bench workloads beside the rig that uses them and makes ownership obvious when this repo becomes a shared rig package.

## Install

Install a package subpath with Homeboy's rig package lifecycle:

```bash
homeboy rig install --all https://github.com/chubes4/homeboy-rigs.git//Automattic/studio
homeboy rig install --all https://github.com/chubes4/homeboy-rigs.git//chubes4/intelligence-chubes4
```

Stack specs currently need to be copied into `~/.config/homeboy/stacks/` until stack package installation lands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/homeboy/stacks
cp Automattic/studio/stacks/*.json ~/.config/homeboy/stacks/
cp WordPress/wordpress-playground/stacks/*.json ~/.config/homeboy/stacks/
```

## Automattic/studio

`rigs/studio/rig.json` is the Studio + Playground combined-fixes dev environment: forks rebased onto trunk, open PRs cherry-picked, Docker-compiled PHP-WASM glue, tarball server, and Studio CLI rewired to local tarballs.

```bash
homeboy rig check studio
homeboy rig up studio
homeboy rig down studio
```

`rigs/studio-bfb/rig.json` is the local Studio/BFB mu-plugin playground rig. It verifies raw HTML writes store native blocks through the BFB substrate.

`rigs/studio-agent-sdk/rig.json` and `rigs/studio-agent-pi/rig.json` are paired bench rigs for Studio agent-runtime A/B checks. They share `bench/studio-agent-runtime.bench.mjs`.

`stacks/studio-combined.json` rebuilds `fork/dev/combined-fixes` from `origin/trunk` plus Chris's active Automattic/studio local-dev PRs.

## WordPress/wordpress-playground

`stacks/playground-combined.json` rebuilds `origin/dev/combined-fixes` from `upstream/trunk` plus Chris's active PHP-WASM and worker-pool PRs.

## chubes4/intelligence-chubes4

`rigs/intelligence-chubes4/rig.json` points the live WordPress plugin symlinks at the worktree being tested. Edit `components.<id>.path`, then run `homeboy rig up intelligence-chubes4`.

## chubes4/isolated-block-editor

`rigs/isolated-block-editor/rig.json` runs the checks used while shaving Isolated Block Editor toward modern Gutenberg APIs.

## Conventions

- **Component paths** use `~/Developer/<repo>` for primary checkouts and `~/Developer/<repo>@<branch-slug>` for worktrees, mirroring the data-machine-code workspace convention.
- **Package directories** use the owning repo's fully qualified name. Cross-repo rigs live under the product/workflow owner.
- **Bench workloads** live beside their owning rig. Today rig specs still reference them by explicit path; package-relative bench workload resolution belongs in Homeboy once the portable bench surface hardens.
- **Branches** in `components.<id>.branch` document the expected branch — rigs don't currently enforce branch state, but the field hints to humans reading the spec.
- **Patches** carry a unique marker string (`PHP-WASM-COMBINED-FIXES TSRMLS fallback`, etc.) that identifies the patch in the file. Marker-based idempotency means re-running `up` is safe.
- **External services** (`kind: external`) are processes the rig didn't spawn — the rig only knows how to *stop* them via `discover.pattern`. Use this for stale daemons that need recycling after a build.

## What does NOT belong here

- Site state (DB, uploads) — Studio site backups handle that.
- Agent state (MEMORY.md, wiki, skills) — DMC GitSync handles that.
- Source code (plugins, themes) — already tracked in their own repos.
- Secrets — rigs reference env vars or sigillo paths; never embed.

## Per-machine state

Each rig writes runtime state (PIDs, last-up timestamps, service status) to `<id>.state/` next to `<id>.json`. Those directories are `.gitignore`d — they're not portable across machines.
